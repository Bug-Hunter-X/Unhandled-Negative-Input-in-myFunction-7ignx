# Unhandled Negative Input in myFunction

This repository demonstrates a common error in MATLAB: failure to handle negative input values gracefully. The `myFunction.m` file contains a function that multiplies the input by 2 but throws an error if the input is negative. The error message is generic and not very helpful to the user.

The `bugSolution.m` file provides a corrected version of the function, including more informative error handling and a check for valid input types.
